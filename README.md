# Roscov (idea)

A general coverage tool to obtain code coverage for ROS code. Works for C++ code only in packages, repositories, and workspaces.

I worked on this during an internship at @plusone-robotics, and thought about turning into a standalone python tool for easier use in CI/CD pipelines. The base code is what's here, but it could use some improvements.
